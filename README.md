Alternatively they can be downloaded to your machine.
You will need to install either anaconda or python on your machine.

Anaconda is available here https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual Please not that this is a large download and includes python.

Python can be downloaded from here https://www.python.org/downloads/ if you do not wish to use anaconda.
<br>   
You may need to run pip install for the following python packages depending on your download choice.
 - numpy				- a python module that specializes in arrays and random numbers
 - matplotlib.pyplot 	- a module to visualize findings in charts, plots, etc
 - seaborn 		- makes plots prettier sits on top of pyplot
 - scipy.stats 				- python statisical package
 - sklearn  		- python machine learning package

# Overview
The **scikit-learn** notebook is for the first part of the assignment for this module. It provides a quick overview of what is available in the package, how to use it, brief explanations of their purpose, illustrations of their use and where to go for further information. It covers three algorithms in more depth namely train,split,check. It analyses the iris data set to see these in action. 

The **scipy-stats** notebook is for the second part of the assignment. It  also provides a quick overview of what is available in the package, how to use it, brief explanations of their purpose, illustrations of their use and where to go for further information. It covers the steps used in performing an ANOVA and . I have used an asthma research data set to demonstrate these in action.
